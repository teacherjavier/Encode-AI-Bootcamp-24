A Chicken Sandwich might not be traditional Mediterranean cuisine, but it's a versatile dish that can be adapted to fit Mediterranean flavors elegantly. Here's how to bring a touch of the Mediterranean to your Chicken Sandwich:

### Ingredients:

- 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon dried basil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tomato, sliced
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
- A handful of fresh arugula or mixed greens
- 4 slices of whole-grain or sourdough bread
- 2 tablespoons hummus
- 1 tablespoon tzatziki sauce
- Feta cheese, crumbled (optional)

### Instructions:

1. **Marinate the Chicken:**
   - In a bowl, mix the olive oil, oregano, basil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. Add the chicken breasts and ensure they are well coated with the marinade. Let them marinate for at least 30 minutes in the refrigerator.

2. **Cook the Chicken:**
   - Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, grill the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until fully cooked through and nicely charred on the outside. Remove from heat and let it rest for a couple of minutes before slicing.

3. **Prepare the Sandwich:**
   - Toast the slices of bread lightly. Spread hummus on two slices and tzatziki sauce on the other two.
   - On the hummus-spread slices, layer the sliced chicken, tomato slices, red onion, arugula (or mixed greens), and crumbled feta, if using.
   - Top each with the tzatziki-spread slices of bread to complete the sandwich.

### To Serve:
- Cut each sandwich in half and serve immediately. Consider serving with a side of olives or a small salad to keep it fresh and in line with Mediterranean flavors.

This Chicken Sandwich brings in the fresh, vibrant flavors of the Mediterranean through ingredients like hummus, tzatziki, and olive oil, elevating it beyond the ordinary.

The classic chicken sandwich, while delicious, can sometimes be a bit too simple and might lack the depth of flavor and freshness Mediterranean cuisine is known for. A great way to elevate this dish and incorporate a zestier, fresher taste would be to add some Mediterranean ingredients and techniques.

Firstly, consider marinating the chicken. A mix of olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, and a blend of herbs such as oregano, thyme, and rosemary can infuse the chicken with aromatic flavors, typical of the Mediterranean palette. Marinate for at least an hour, or overnight for an enhanced taste.

Instead of a regular sandwich bread, opt for a ciabatta or focaccia, which are both heartier and will add a nice texture contrast. Adding a spread can make a big difference too; a basil pesto or a spread made from roasted red peppers and feta cheese can elevate the sandwich significantly.

For the vegetables, think beyond the lettuce and tomato. Consider incorporating grilled vegetables like zucchini, eggplant, or bell peppers for a smoky flavor. A quick pickled red onion can add a nice tangy crunch that will contrast beautifully with the rich flavors of the rest of the sandwich.

By implementing these changes, the chicken sandwich will not only be tastier but will also embody the essence of Mediterranean cuisine, making it a refreshing and satisfying meal.
